# Genome annotations

These are the genome annotations required by te_hic
They are trimmed merges of the RMSK UCSC track and the GENCODE annotations
Two geneome are supported, mm10 and hg38, and the python scripts to generate them are here.

You need to download the gtfs and track data. wget commands are in the download_data.sh script.

Then run make_*.py

Note that you need a pretty large amount of RAM, probably around 16GB should do it.
